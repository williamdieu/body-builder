## About

Body-builder is a tool designed to scrape bodybuilding.com to create an exercise list which can then be used to generate exercise sessions. This allows for a diverse range of exercises that the user can apply suitable for both beginners (who want to expose themselves to a wide variety) and regulars (who are plateauing due to repetitive motions and wish to fix that).
